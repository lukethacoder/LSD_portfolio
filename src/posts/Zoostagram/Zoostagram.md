#The Project
This is still a work in progress and will be finished by the due date, mid May. 

#Technologies Used 
***
Zoostagram uses React, as well as utalising SASS and other NPM technologies. Google Firebase is used to store all user and quiz data, as well as provide authentication for users.

#The Project Brief
***
The overall aim of the project was to create a mobile web application that would target both adults and children, each having their own half of the app designed and developed with their needs in mind.

##Journey
***
The journey section is targeted more towards the adults and is to be used by the parents of the children attending the CZA, but also young adults who may also enjoy documenting their CZA adventures. The journey will allows users to photograph anything they wish whilst at the CZA, this may include selfies, animals, food, friends, family, etc. This aims to get people engaged and sharing with each other whilst creating something for them to look back on once they eventually leave the CZA.

##Learn
***
The learn section is targeted more towards children aged 6-10 and is to be used to test their knowledge of the animals they see whilst at the zoo. It aims to encourage learning and rewards the users with points which can then be used to redeem physical rewards from the zoo shop; similar to how tickets at the arcade can get your rewards.

#The Team
***
##Luke- Developer
My personal contribution to the project was developing all of the functionality for the Learn side of the app. This involved creating a quiz layout page using dynamic data pulled from our Firebase database. I had to collaborate with both Tim and Will to make sure I was creating the right elements to match the designs. 

In addition to the functionality of the Learn component, I was tasked with creating the functionality for the achievements. This involved adding additional code to Adriaan's Profile files and creating a simple layout and individual view for each achievement the user had earnt so far.

I was also in charge of populating the database with quizzes. This was a simple enough process as Google Firebase is very intuitive, most of the time.

##Tim - Lead Designer
Tim was our designer and had a very strong influence on design and pushing for certain features to be added/changed. Being more design focused we agreed that Tim would complete all the design and user experience work for the project, with the exception of certain parts of the journey side which Adriaan designed. 

##Adriaan - Developer
Adriaan had initially proposed the idea and he knew which technologies to use and how to use them. He developed the whole Journey side of the app (functionality and styling) as well as the login and profile components.

##Will - Developer
Will was our styling developer for the Learn side of the application. Will needed to collaborate with both Tim and myself to make sure styling met the designs and integrated well with the functionality.


#Technologies Used
***
The main technologies used for this project were Googles Firebase, React and NPM packages. The initial setup involved us using create-react-app instead of manually setting up all the configuration ourselves. React allows our application to be dynamic in ways plain old html websites can't be. In addition to React we used NPM to download packages for use within our application. 

Other non-development technologies we used included Trello, Github and Waka time.

#The Result
***
The final product is a beautifully designed and function web application. The project is different 
and unique in that no other institution out there (that I know of) would have anything similar to what we have built.
