# Process

## Logo
The logo uses the font Weekly, with Montserrat Thin to compliment it. The colour scheme uses <i style="color: #8E7C60; font-style: normal;">#8E7C60</i> Gold and <i style="color: #3A3A3A; font-style: normal;">#3A3A3A</i> Dark Grey. The gold colour is meant to represent the countrysidem, but also add elements of professionalism. The dark grey is to add to the professionalism too, and give a contrasting colour to the <i style="color: #F2F2F2; font-style: normal;">#F2F2F2</i> off white.


## Website Design
cool info about the design of the website

## Website Development

The website is a super simple one page website built using GatsbyJS (React). Very basic usage of GatsbyJS's main features were used, and was only chosen as the framework of choice because thats what I was using/learning at the time.
