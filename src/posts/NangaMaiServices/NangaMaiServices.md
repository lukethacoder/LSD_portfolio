#The Project
***
Design direction, including a logo and website design, were the main parts of the project. The client was after a professional look, but also not to stem too far away from the 'farm' aesthetic. The use of a background image from the clients business location mixed with a friendly photo of the CEO greets potential clients with a warm and welcoming feeling.
